  <h6>By streaming her re-recorded versions! </h6>

  <p>
    Since it's hard for Taylor to get her masters back, she has instead decided
    to re-record her albums. So far, she has re-recorded her second album, <i>Fearless</i>. 
    The album also included unreleased songs.
    You will know a song is the the re-recorded version becasue they will include
    "Taylor's Version" in the title. She has also released her version of one of her songs, 
    <i>Wildest Dreams</i>, becasue of a trend on Tik Tok involving that song. 
    The release of <i>Red (Taylor's Version)</i> is scheduled to come out in November.

  <h6>Why is it important to stream "Taylor's Version" of songs?</h6>
  <p>
    Re-recording her songs is her way of reclaiming her music. And this time around, she will be able
    to have full control over how the music is produced. She hopes that her re-recorded versions will be
    sought out instead of the original. Hlping to buy and stream her new versions will be a way
    to support her and help rally more attention around the new ones instead.
