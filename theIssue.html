  <h6>Background</h6>

  <p>When Taylor Swift started her career, she signed with a company called Big Machine. She signed 
    with them at the age of 15. She gave them the rights to her first 6 albums for a cash advance.
    But in 2018, she left to become a part of Public Records and Universal Music Group instead.
    In 2019, Big Machine was bought by Scooter Braun's company, Ithaca Holdings. Which means
    Scooter Braun owned the masters (the first recording of a song) to Taylor Swift's first
    6 albums as well. Taylor had been trying to buy the 
    masters of her albums back for a while, but wasn't allowed to unless she 
    signed onto another contract with Big Machine. She didn't want to becasue she knew the 
    label was being prepared to be sold. The fact that Scooter Braun had control of her 
    masters was her worst nightmare. Later, those albums were sold to Shamrock. Initially, Taylor
    thought this was good news until she realized Braun would still be profiting from them. 
  </p>
  
  <br><br>

  <h6>What's the issue with Scooter Braun?</h6>
  <p>
    Scooter Braun had previously represented Kanye West. Taylor Swift and Kanye West have not
    been on constantly good terms since he took the microphone from her while she was receiving
    her award at the VMAs in 2009. Since then, a bigger controversy, regarding Kanye's song 
    "Famous," has broken out. Taylor Swift was offended both by a lyric in the song and how she 
    was portrayed in the music video. Taylor claims she didn't know a lyric was going to be
    written about her, while Kanye and his wife at the time, Kim Kardashian, claim that she did.
    Both Kim and Kanye bashed Taylor Swift in public for 
    alledly lying. Braun was Kanye's manager at this time. Taylor accuses Braun of bullying her, 
    sending his two clients after her. Braun's legal team had even recently insisted she sign 
    woan NDA so she couldn't 
    talk about Braun unless it was to say good things about him. So obviously, Taylor Swift 
    would not feel comfortable with him having control over her masters or continuing to profit 
    from them.
  </p>

  <h6>Why are masters so important?</h6>
  <p>
    Owning the master means you own every copy, including those that are put onto music
    platforms and even physical copies. Therefore if Braun owned those 6 albums, that means
    he makes money from the sales and streams of those copies. However, it's not just the 
    money aspect. Every artist should be able to have the rights to their
    own music. Not being able to have the rights to your own music must be very
    frustrating. Some may say it's her fault for signing the rights to her own songs away, but 
    she was 15 at the time and didn't know how important those masters would be to her in the 
    future. Her family was new to the music industry, and money is money, so they probbaly
    didn't think too much into it. And artists should be able to change their minds.
